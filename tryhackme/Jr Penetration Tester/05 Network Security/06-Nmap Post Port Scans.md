## Task 2  Service Detection

### Start the target machine for this task and launch the AttackBox. Run nmap -sV --version-light MACHINE_IPvia the AttackBox. What is the detected version for port 143?
    Dovecot imapd

### Which service did not have a version detected with --version-light? 
    rpcbind

## Task 3  OS Detection and Traceroute

### Run nmap with -O option against MACHINE_IP. What OS did Nmap detect?
    Linux

## Task 4  Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

    http-vuln-cve2015-1635

### Launch the AttackBox if you haven't already. After you ensure you have terminated the VM from Task 2, start the target machine for this task. On the AttackBox, run Nmap with the default scripts -sC against MACHINE_IP. You will notice that there is a service listening on port 53. What is its full version value?
    9.9.5-9+deb8u19-Debian

### Based on its description, the script ssh2-enum-algos “reports the number of algorithms (for encryption, compression, etc.) that the target SSH2 server offers.” What is the name of the key exchange algorithms (kex_algorithms) that relies upon “sha1” and is supported by MACHINE_IP?
    diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

## Task 5  Saving the Output

### Check the attached Nmap logs. How many systems are listening on the HTTPS port?
